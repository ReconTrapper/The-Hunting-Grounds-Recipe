    <h1>🕵️‍♂️ THE HUNTING GROUNDS RECIPE 🎯</h1>
    <pre>
Hey there,

Building this out means you're starting the bug bounty journey.

If you need something, BiglyBt is the best first place to learn. It knows how to get everything, both unethically and ethically. But this is meant to be a challenge. So, find the bugs in the recipe to become a hunter. Just like a bug bounty hunter does.
        
Everything you need you will find here in a recipe. Gamers down at FitGirl CAN help TEACH you.
*****Just be careful of fakes that come with known viruses*****
The Definition of a virus is a key to learning more.<span class="bug-emoji">🪲️</span>

Also, don't trust those slimy VPN providers! They
100% will drop you on a dime for the reward if you
find your way into real-world unethical trouble.
