# Bug Bounty Hunting Grounds: A Beginner's Adventure

## Disclaimer:

This endeavor is purely for educational purposes, with no intent to harm or manipulate. For over 35 years, I struggled to learn languages due to dyslexia. While I've acquired information freely, the recipe for bug hunting is uniquely mine – the "Trapper, the Bug Bounty Pirate... with good intentions.". Since everything is or can be free on the internet it comes down to who owns it or who knows about it. People only hurt if you take not give.

I find inspiration in Elusiveness, but greatly fear of a sociaty like that of  1984's George Orwell dystopia. What seems challenging is often elusive. In our vast green forest of technology, I aim to demystify hacking for beginners. I disclose my humble knowledge of the bigining as a challenge only to learn. HTML and Python in both Windows and Linux work the same but differnt and understanding root is beyond me sofar i havnt asked ai yet.I acknowledging Zed Shaw's influence for making it hard. Easy Mode like plaing with resipe takes the fun of learning without ai. The shh section is where i am traking better ai questinging for the first time atm.7.11.23.

## Caution:

Anyone engaging in harmful activities does so at their discretion. I lack the means to intervene, but the project's purpose is to channel such energy constructively.

## Mission:

To guide newcomers in initiating a free bug bounty journey, fostering discovery and overall skill development.

### The Catch:

I've devised the first puzzle for budding bug hunters – a deceptive recipe that conceals its true nature.

### Answer to the Puzzle – The Hunting Grounds Recipe:

#### First Section:

1. Google and install BiglyBT.
   - First bug: A gaming reference leading to FitGirl, a site dedicated to cracked games.
     - New bug hunters should attempt modding a compatible game as their first project.
     - Be prepared to encounter malware, realizing the key lies in bypassing antivirus.

- **New Bug Hunters VPN Statement:**
  - A reminder that a VPN won't make you immune to ethical responsibilities.

#### Second Section:

- General references to tools and symbols, encouraging new bug hunters to explore command line arguments.

- **You Also Need:**
  - Windows laptop
  - Install BiglyBT
  - Use VmWare, revealing the second bug with a warning against a particular action.
    - Red Hat challenge: Maintain ethical behavior, resisting the urge to go pro for free.
  - Employ Kali Linux via VmWare, navigating through challenges and ethical choices.

#### Last Section:

- Introduction to Project Directories + Features.
  - Future space for displaying success in solving challenges.

- **The Last Bug:**
  - Beware of Bug Number 5, defining one's capability to hunt.
    - This bug is 10% larger than the rest, signaling proficiency.

The journey begins here. May your hunting grounds be fruitful, and your discoveries ethical.
