# Bug Bounty Hunting Grounds: A Beginner's Adventure

## Disclaimer:

This endeavor is purely for educational purposes, with no intent to harm or manipulate. For over 35 years, I struggled to learn languages due to dyslexia. While I'veacquired information freely, the recipe for entering is uniquely mine – "Trapper, the Bug Bounty Pirate"... Since everything is or can be free on the internet it comes down to who owns it or who knows about it. People only hurt if you take not give.

I find inspiration in Elusiveness, but greatly fear of a sociaty like that of  1984's George Orwell dystopia. What seems challenging is often elusive. In our vast greenforest of technology, I aim to demystify hacking for beginners. I disclose my humble knowledge of the bigining as a challenge only to learn. .

## Caution:

Anyone engaging in harmful activities does so at their discretion. I lack the means to intervene, but the project's purpose is to channel such energy constructively toward stopping gate keepers and unethical hackers.

## Mission:

To guide newcomers in initiating a free bug bounty journey, fostering discovery and overall skill development.
