    <h1>üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è THE HUNTING GROUNDS RECIPE üéØ</h1>

    <section>
        <u>Disclaimer:</u> This endeavor is purely for educational purposes, with no intent to harm or manipulate. For over
        35 years, I struggled to learn languages due to dyslexia. While I've acquired information freely, the recipe for bug
        hunting is uniquely mine ‚Äì the "Trapper, the Bug Bounty Pirate... with good intentions.". Since everything is or
        can be free on the internet it comes down to who owns it or who knows about it. People only hurt if you take not
        give.
        <u>Caution:</u> Anyone engaging in harmful activities does so at their discretion. I lack the means to intervene,
        but the project's purpose is to channel such energy constructively.
        <u>Mission:</u> To guide newcomers in initiating a free bug bounty journey, fostering discovery and overall skill
        development.
        <u>The Catch:</u> I've devised the first puzzle for budding bug hunters ‚Äì a deceptive recipe that conceals its true
        nature.
    </section>
    <section>
        <u>Answer to the Puzzle ‚Äì The Hunting Grounds Recipe:</u>
        1. Google and install BiglyBT.
        - First bug: A gaming reference leading to FitGirl, a site dedicated to cracked games.
        - New bug hunters should attempt modding a compatible game as their first project.
        - Be prepared to encounter malware, realizing the key lies in bypassing antivirus.
        <u>New Bug Hunters VPN Statement:</u>
        - A reminder that a VPN won't make you immune to ethical responsibilities.
        - General references to tools and symbols, encouraging new bug hunters to explore command line arguments.
        - Introduction to Project Directories + Features.
        - Future space for displaying success in solving challenges.
        <u>The Last Bug:</u>
        - Beware of Bug Number 5, defining one's capability to hunt.
        - This bug is 10% larger than the rest, signaling proficiency. The journey begins here. May your hunting grounds be
        fruitful, and your discoveries ethical.
        <!-- Added class to the bug emoji link for styling -->
        Watch out for bugs in the recipe. <a href="HINTS.html" class="bug-link-emoji">ü™≤Ô∏è</a>
